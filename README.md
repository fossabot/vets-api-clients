Welcome to the repository for consumers of **VA Lighthouse APIs**. It includes API specifications, sample clients, and general access information. This README was last updated December 2020. For the most up-to-date Lighthouse API documentation, please visit developer.va.gov/explore. API documentation found in this repo may be outdated.

If you would like to improve or suggest **edits to API documentation** for the VA APIs, please visit the [APIs repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) or the [Developer Portal repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/developer-portal).

If you are a third party seeking access to VA Lighthouse APIs, you will need to complete a quick application to obtain an API key. Once you have your API key, you can access our APIs in a sandbox environment. We grant production access later after scheduling a [demo of your application](https://developer.va.gov/go-live) for stakeholders and ensuring all requirements are met.
